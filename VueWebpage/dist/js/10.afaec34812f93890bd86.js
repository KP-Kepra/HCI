Firstly the idea is made within the context to meet users' needs and problems in daily life. And with that, the idea is validated and implemented into code to run a 24-hour server in Raspberry Pi. Lastly, feedbacks are gathered from the users after testing the prototypes."},{index:2,title:"Human-Robot Interaction",content:"The final project is similar to second project (needfinding, brainstorming and validation, prototype design, and conclusion) with added usability testing as our user feedback. We base our idea on helping costumers order food faster, alongside with lighten the workload of employees by having to prepare and serve the foods only. The idea is implemented in NaoRobot, using Choregraphe application with Nao V5 Software Development Kit. We also receive various feedbacks from groups and students along the way"}];i.a=t}});
