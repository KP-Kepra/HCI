We base our idea on helping costumers order food faster, alongside with lighten the workload of employees by having to prepare and serve the foods only. The idea is implemented in NaoRobot, using Choregraphe application with Nao V5 Software Development Kit. We also receive various feedbacks from groups and students along the way",
